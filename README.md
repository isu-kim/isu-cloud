# Isu-Cloud
I am an cloud infrastructure ~~slave~~ enthusiast for my both two labs and my free time. In order to keep my settings and share some useful information across those servers, this repository was introduced.
> In order to keep my environments safe, I will be screening out some contents which are considered to be confidential. Only safe informations will be shared here.
